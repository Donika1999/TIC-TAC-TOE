# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Field Programmable Gate Arrays
Tic-Tac-Toe is a very popular paper-and-pencil game in a 3x3 grid for two players. In this project, a
player plays the Tic Tac Toe game with a computer.

The machine is playing a defensive game and hence, the human player will always move first. Each
time the player moves, the machine waits for two seconds before making its move.

Input is be a 3 X 3 array, a reset button, and a switch SW1. If SW1 is off, the computer always wins
if possible, or draw (nobody wins) if winning is not possible. If SW1 is on, part of the machineâ€™s logic
gets bypassed so that the player can win occasionally. Output will be a 3 X 3 array of LEDs with a
red and a green LED in each square. Two LEDs are used to indicate player wins or computer wins.
If the game is a draw, both LEDs light.
